            <p class="text">
                An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports.
                <br><br>
                Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.

            </div>

            <p class="text">Cycling (also known as bicycling or biking) is the riding of bicycles (also cycles, or bikes) for leisure or as part of competition. In many countries, the cycle is also an important mode of transport, more so in Asia (especially in Southeast Asia) and Africa. 
                <br><br>
                . Indeed, across the world today, the cycle is the preferred means of conveyance for many commuters. Compared to the ubiquitous motorcar, cycles contribute almost nothing to air or noise pollution, besides giving the rider plenty of opportunity to get in some exercise.

            </div>

            <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. 
                <br><br>
                Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

            </div>

            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a water sport where an athlete rides a wave standing or any other position on a board, or just with his body (body surfing).
                <br><br>
                In competition, each surfer has unconditional right of way for their chosen direction, left or right, based on their priority and dictated by the Priority and Interference Rules.
